# First Post

Here it is. As a beginning, I think to capture here some of my motiviations for starting this project.

I've grown up resisting the pattern all around me of using the web as an outlet for self-expression. I've always been concerned by the tendency for who we are to become distorted when cast through the lens of social media, and the web more generally. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult for me to relate to others for whom the experiences in virtual reality aren't so separate from those in other realities. Maybe this project will help me to better understand the web as a medium for expression and better empathize with the human experiences possible here.

Another motivation is to simply share with the world projects I've undertaken, along with my own thoughts and observations on the world. Beyond serving as a way to refine my own thinking, I hope this project will help me to better understand others through attempting to communicate ideas externally.

Finally, I hope to learn about the process and craft of writing itself. I have experimented with other forms of expression and art, I have never thought of myself as a capable writer. Although I assign great value in being able to present ideas clearly in writing, it isn't something I have given much attention in my life.

I'll leave it there for now.

Sincerely,

Safaa
