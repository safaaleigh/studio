# So many tools âš’

I recently came across a really cool tool called [stackshare](https://stackshare.io) which let's you create lists of software and business tools. We recently wrapped up an internship program at the company I work for and one of the recurring requests from the participants was for us to share ahead of time more about the technology we use.

When I first started working in software I was with a consulting firm called [The BHW Group](http://thebhwgroup.com). Being a consulting firm, we would have the opportunity to frequently evaluate the tools we used and were able to evolve our stack with each new project based on our experience. Now having worked for a product startup called [sibi](https://sibipro.com) for the past few years, I've seen the impact choosing the right tools can have on the way a team works together.

I have compiled my working list of favorite tools [here](https://stackshare.io/safaaleigh/hearted) and [another list](https://stackshare.io/safaaleigh/everythingiveeverused) of all the tools I have ever used. A cool feature of stackshare is that you can post about your experiences with a tool, in particular why you decided to adopt or replace a given tool.

One of the things I love most about working in software is the way the community contributes the product of their work so that others can benefit. I often find myself wishing that a similar set of principles and mechanisms found within the open source community could be applied to other domains. Being part of a culture of learning and building on the ideas of others is highly generative.

It's also amazing how quickly web development continues to evolve. I often find myself helping friends think through how to put stuff on the web or in choosing between different software tools. Recently, I was sitting with a friend and we were able to buy a domain, clone a template and deploy the skeleton for a website for his restaurant startup, all from my phone while sitting on the couch.

I'll end this post by sharing some of the tools I use often and recommend to anyone I can:

### [Notion](http://notion.so)

A workspace for practically everything. It's almost too adaptable. I've used Notion at work for project planning and tracking, meeting notes and basically any kind of documentation as well as for personal note taking, writing and todos. One of my favorite parts is being able to create inline databases for basically anything.

### [Linear](https://linear.app)

I feel like i've used a whole lot of versions of the project board, but Linear is by far the best. While geared towards software engineering, Linear is still the simplest delivery I've seen of how teams can use issue tracking to organize their work. When you lean in to it using the full capabilities of projects, cycles and roadmaps, Linear helps make everyone's work highly visible.

### [GitHub](http://github.com/)
